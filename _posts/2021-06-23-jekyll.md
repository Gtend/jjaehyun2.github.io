### 오류:

#gem install jekyll Building native extensions. This could take a while… ERROR: Error installing jekyll: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

current directory: /var/lib/gems/2.7.0/gems/eventmachine-1.2.7/ext /usr/bin/ruby2.7 -I /usr/lib/ruby/2.7.0 -r ./siteconf20210623-5375-1iun7he.rb extconf.rb mkmf.rb can’t find header files for ruby at /usr/lib/ruby/include/ruby.h

You might have to install separate package for the ruby development environment, ruby-dev or ruby-devel for example.

extconf failed, exit code 1

Gem files will remain installed in /var/lib/gems/2.7.0/gems/eventmachine-1.2.7 for inspection. Results logged to /var/lib/gems/2.7.0/extensions/x86_64-linux/2.7.0/eventmachine-1.2.7/gem_make.out

### 해결:

sudo apt install build-essential ruby-dev make gcc
